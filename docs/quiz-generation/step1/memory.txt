Purpose & context
0 is developing educational content for Korean economic literacy through a specialized quiz game creation system. The project transforms current Korean business news articles into interactive learning materials across three distinct game formats: Black Swan games (analyzing economic chain reactions and cause-and-effect relationships), Prisoner's Dilemma games (evaluating balanced judgment scenarios with competing stakeholder perspectives), and Signal Decoding games (testing comprehension of financial terminology through fill-in-the-blank questions).
The system serves educational or professional training purposes, helping learners understand complex economic concepts, policy implications, and business terminology through real-world Korean news content. Success is measured by creating high-quality, pedagogically sound quiz questions that effectively teach economic literacy using current, relevant examples from Korean markets and policy developments.
Current state
0 is actively working through a structured two-stage content development workflow. In the first stage, they submit collections of Korean business articles (typically 40-70 articles per session) for comprehensive screening and analysis. The system evaluates each article against specific suitability criteria (70%+ threshold) and recommends 9 high-quality candidates distributed across the three game types.
Currently processing diverse Korean economic topics including semiconductor industry developments (Samsung, SK Hynix), monetary policy and interest rates, corporate earnings and financial performance, government fiscal policy, trade negotiations (particularly US-Korea relations), real estate regulations, and emerging technology investments. The workflow involves precise article counting, correction of discrepancies, and initiation of analysis phases using Korean commands ("분석 시작").
Approach & patterns
0 follows a systematic, quality-focused methodology with clear operational preferences. They consistently request concise presentations showing only article titles and analysis content while excluding full article text to maintain brevity and focus on actionable insights. They demonstrate strong attention to accuracy, regularly correcting article counts and ensuring precise data handling.
The workflow operates in structured phases: article submission → count verification → analysis initiation → screening results → selection of 6 articles (2 per game type) → progression to Stage 2 question creation. 0 values topic diversity, specifically requesting variety across different economic sectors to avoid repetitive content patterns. They prefer comprehensive analytical frameworks with detailed production guidelines, scoring rationales, and strategic implementation tips for each recommended article.
