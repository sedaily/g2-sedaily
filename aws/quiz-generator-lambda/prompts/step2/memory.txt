Purpose & context
0 is developing educational content for "서울경제 AI GAMES" (Seoul Economic AI Games), a structured quiz format that teaches logical thinking and economic literacy through current Korean financial news. The project serves multiple audiences including general newspaper readers, job seekers, and new employees, with the goal of building practical economic knowledge and analytical skills. The quiz format transforms real economic news articles into engaging learning exercises that test comprehension, reasoning, and economic concept understanding rather than mere factual recall.
The educational framework centers on three distinct question types: "블랙스완" (Black Swan) for analyzing cause-and-effect chain reactions, "죄수의 딜레마" (Prisoner's Dilemma) for examining balanced stakeholder perspectives and strategic trade-offs, and "시그널 디코딩" (Signal Decoding) for interpreting economic data and financial terminology. Each quiz set contains six questions total (two sets of three), with questions designed to be solvable based solely on provided context without requiring external knowledge.
Current state
0 is actively refining quiz construction methodology and content quality standards. Recent work focuses on ensuring questions test genuine economic understanding rather than pattern recognition, with emphasis on creating plausible but definitively incorrect answer choices that require two-step reasoning to eliminate. Current iterations involve systematic review of answer choice distribution, linguistic consistency across options, and appropriate difficulty calibration for the target audience.
The content development process involves detailed feedback cycles addressing structural issues like overly obvious correct answers, insufficient context for fill-in-the-blank questions, and answer choices that don't match question scope. 0 consistently requests specific formatting standards including 4-5 line news article summaries, balanced answer choice lengths to avoid telegraphing correct answers, and formal journalistic language choices.
Key learnings & principles
Questions must be solvable independently of source articles, relying on complete logical frameworks within the quiz content itself. Effective multiple choice questions require clear scope definition, with answer choices that directly address the question's specific focus rather than tangentially related concepts. For example, questions about "foreign exchange market changes" should offer currency-specific options rather than broader economic impacts.
Black Swan questions should test genuine chain-reaction analysis requiring understanding of underlying economic mechanisms, not simple cause-and-effect relationships. The most effective approach shifts perspective from "what happens when X occurs" to "why did X choose Y over Z," which requires understanding strategic business relationships and market dynamics.
Signal Decoding questions work best when focused on established economic terminology (like CET1, PBR, ROA) rather than policy language or overly specialized jargon. Terms should be practically useful for the target audience while maintaining appropriate difficulty levels. Answer explanations should define key economic concepts for educational reinforcement without interpretive commentary.
Approach & patterns
Quiz development follows a structured iterative process with systematic quality evaluation across multiple dimensions: logical consistency, answer choice viability, appropriate difficulty levels, and educational value. Each question type requires specific construction principles - Black Swan questions need plausible multi-step reasoning paths, Prisoner's Dilemma questions must present genuinely balanced competing interests, and Signal Decoding questions should test comprehension of financial terminology within proper context.
Content review focuses on eliminating structural problems including clustering of correct answers on specific options, weak distractors that could be considered partially correct, and questions that rely too heavily on prior knowledge rather than reading comprehension. The revision process emphasizes creating attractive but definitively wrong answer choices that test genuine understanding.
Formatting standards include consistent presentation sequence (Set 1, Set 1 answers, Set 2, Set 2 answers), detailed explanations of 3-4 lines for educational value, and news article summaries expanded to exactly 4-5 sentences for proper context. Answer choice construction avoids making correct answers obvious through length differences or grammatical inconsistencies.
